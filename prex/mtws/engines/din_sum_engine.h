// outputs choose a random interpolation point inside the interval between the
// shared sine and their saw targets, with Y crossfading the `p` noise source
// between smooth low-passed and nervous high-passed variants. Out1 uses the
// local ramp-up saw, while Out2 uses the same ramp-up saw evaluated 90 degrees
// later. In alt mode, the oscillator becomes cycle-locked and probabilistic:
// each phase wrap chooses either sine or saw for the whole cycle, with saw
// probability set by X and decision stickiness set by Y.
